DL evaluation on N-CMAPSS

## Sample creator
Following the below instruction, you can create training/test sample arrays for machine learning model (especially for DL architectures that allow time-windowed data as input) from NASA's N-CMAPSS datafile. <br/>
Please download Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set-2, so called N-CMAPSS dataset [[2]](#2), from [NASA's prognostic data repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) <br/>
In the downloaded dataset, dataset DS01 has been used for the application of model-based diagnostics and dataset DS02 has been used for data-driven prognostics.   Therefore, we need only dataset DS02. <br/> 
Please locate "N-CMAPSS_DS02-006.h5"file to /N-CMAPSS folder. <br/>
Then, you can get npz files for each of 9 engines by running the python codes below. 
```bash
python3 sample_creator_unit_auto.py -w 50 -s 1 --test 0 --sampling 10
```
After that, you should run 
```bash
python3 sample_creator_unit_auto.py -w 50 -s 1 --test 1 --sampling 10
```
&ndash;  w : window length <br/>
&ndash;  s : stride of window <br/>
&ndash;  test : select train or test, if it is zero, then the code extracts samples from the engines used for training. Otherwise, it creates samples from test engines<br/>
&ndash;  sampling : subsampling the data before creating the output array so that we can set assume different sampling rate to mitigate memory issues. 

## DL model

For the baseline model, run 
```bash
python3 baseline_run.py 
```
